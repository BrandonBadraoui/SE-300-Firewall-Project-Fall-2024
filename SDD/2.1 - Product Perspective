The firewall system is designed with several critical capabilities to ensure robust and dynamic network traffic monitoring and control. It continuously monitors and logs both incoming and outgoing network traffic, capturing vital details such as protocols, destination and source IP addresses, ports, and timestamps. This data is analyzed in real-time to detect any unusual or potentially harmful connection behaviors. 
The firewall uses an internal database of whitelisted and blacklisted IP addresses or domains to make decisions about whether to allow, block, or flag traffic for further scrutiny. By comparing real-time traffic patterns with historical connection logs, the system can assess whether the behavior of a source aligns with typical patterns. When a source is identified as potentially malicious, the firewall can take preemptive action to mitigate any threats. 
For trusted or whitelisted sources, data packets are forwarded through the network without interruption. If a connection is deemed suspicious or originates from a blacklisted source, the firewall can either block the data entirely or prompt the user for manual intervention. In cases where a connection is denied, the system can dynamically update the blacklist to permanently block future attempts from that source, ensuring ongoing network protection unless explicitly overridden by a user.	This architecture supports a proactive and adaptive approach to network security, capable of evolving in response to new threats while maintaining user control over trusted traffic.
