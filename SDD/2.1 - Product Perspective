The firewall system is designed with several key capabilities to ensure secure network traffic monitoring and control. It actively monitors and logs all incoming and outgoing internet traffic, capturing essential data like protocols, destinations, sources, IP addresses, and timestamps. This information is analyzed to detect any unusual connection behavior. The firewall relies on an internal list of white-listed and black-listed sources to allow or block traffic. By comparing current traffic with historical connection logs, it can assess whether a source is behaving normally. If a source is flagged as malicious, the firewall takes action. For legitimate sources, data packets are forwarded as expected. In cases where a connection appears suspicious or has been blacklisted, the firewall either blocks the data entirely or prompts the user for approval. If denied, the source can be permanently blacklisted, preventing future connections unless the blacklist is updated. This system architecture ensures a proactive and adaptive approach to network security.
