For this program to work, the user will be assumed to meet some requirements. Due to the nature and scope of our project, there will be a few things that are required from the user, some of which are: 
The user must have a device (either physical or VM) that is running the Debian Linux OS. 
The user must be connected to any network for the firewall to filter networks. 
The user will have to install the firewall onto their system.  
For the user to set their own ruleset, the user must have a basic understanding of how a firewall works and what it blocks. 
The user must be able to install a kernel module on their device 
More to comeâ€¦.
