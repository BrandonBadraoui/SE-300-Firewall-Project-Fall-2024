For the firewall system to function as intended, it is assumed that users will meet several key requirements due to the nature and scope of the project. These requirements include: 
The user must have access to a device, either physical or virtual, running the Debian Linux operating system. 
The user must be connected to a network in order for the firewall to perform traffic filtering. 
The user is responsible for installing the firewall onto their system. 
To configure custom rulesets, the user must have a basic understanding of how firewalls operate, including the types of traffic they block or allow. 
The user must have the capability to install and load kernel modules on their device, as the firewall operates at the kernel level. 

Additional assumptions and dependencies may be identified as the project progresses.
