The firewall consists of three primary structures. The most basic structure is a driver which operates as a kernel. This kernel is responsible for receiving the incoming network activity and passing it on to the firewall software to be analyzed. The kernel manages the memory storage location of each packet and does not permit it to be sent to the user without approval from the firewall. 
The firewall software contains a class whose primary purpose is to read-in packet data from the kernel driver and compare it against a set of predetermined rules set by the user. The software has functions that call to the kernel to read, delete, or forward packets. 
The firewall software also has a feature that will notify the user of strange requests with the ability to update the rules list to either permit or block the packets.
