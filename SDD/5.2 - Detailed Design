Then you need to start describing your design in detail. In this section, you describe each class, the job that the class performs, and how it relates to the other classes. You may want to, or need to, provide algorithms for any complex computations. This discussion must refer to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram discussed below. 
In addition to the descriptive text, you will supply a UML class diagram of your software design. The UML diagram is a simple pictorial representation of your design. The UML you provide must match the software that you turn in (it is normal to change the design a little as you go â€“ do not forget to update the UML!). Finally, you may also want to include one or more state diagrams for your system. State diagram is one of the most effective ways to represent the system behavior as it receives stimulus or progress through different stages.
