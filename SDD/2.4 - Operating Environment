The operating environment for this firewall system will be based on Debian Linux. The firewall code will run on a Debian Linux server hosted on virtual machines (VMs) created using VMWare software. We will utilize GNS3 to virtualize the entire network infrastructure, including VMs simulating the internet, firewall, and protected devices. 
Debian Linux was selected for its lightweight footprint, making it efficient to run on virtual machines, and for its strong support and usability when programming network drivers. GNS3 was chosen for its simplicity in implementing network virtualization and the valuable networking resources it provides for simulating real-world network scenarios. 
By using these software tools, we can test the firewall system in a safe, isolated, and controllable environment before integrating it into larger, real-world systems. This setup allows us to simulate constant interaction with external networks, systems, and devices that may attempt to access or pass through the firewall. 
During the testing and design phases, this software will be operated strictly in indoor environments. However, once the project is completed, the software will be deployable on any system running Debian Linux, regardless of the physical or geographical location.
