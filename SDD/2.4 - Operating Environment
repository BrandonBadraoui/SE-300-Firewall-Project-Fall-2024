The operating environment for this system will be in Debian Linux. The firewall code will run on a Debian Linux server that is hosted on a Virtual Machines created through the VMWare software. We will utilize GNS3 to virtualize all our network, including VMs acting as the internet, firewall, and protected devices. The reason we chose to use Debian Linux is because of its small package (Makes it easy to run on a VM) and its usability when programing network drivers. GNS3 was chosen due to its simple nature for implementing network virtualization, and the useful networking resources it provides. By utilizing these different forms of software, our project can be tested in a safe and controllable environment prior to introducing it to a greater system environment and real-world actors. It will be in constant contact with external networks, systems, and any other devices that may try to pass through our system. 
	As far as geographical environments are concerned during our testing/design, this software will be strictly used indoors. Once the project is complete, the software will be able to be implemented on any system that is using Debian Linux, whether it is inside, outside, etc.
