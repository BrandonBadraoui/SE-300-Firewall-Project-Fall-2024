The biggest constraint for our project is time. Many firewalls are developed over the span of years rather than one semester, making it tough for us to have a very versatile firewall. Another effect that this time constraint causes is the inability to create robust testing methods. Due to these constraints, we will have to virtualize all the networks and malicious attacks that our firewall sees. 
Another thing that could be considered a constraint is the fact that we will most likely be unable to incorporate any sort of GUI in our project. Due to the fact that this project will be operating inside of the Linux kernel, the only display that will most likely be seen is what the terminal spits out based on our firewall code.
