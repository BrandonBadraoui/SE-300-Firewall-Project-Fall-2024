The primary constraint for our project is time. Firewall development is typically an extensive process, often spanning several years. However, given that we are working within the timeframe of a single semester, it will be challenging to develop a highly versatile and feature-rich firewall system. This time constraint also limits our ability to implement comprehensive and robust testing methods. As a result, we will rely on virtualized environments to simulate both the networks and malicious attacks that our firewall will need to handle. 
Another significant constraint is the lack of a graphical user interface (GUI). Since the firewall will operate within the Linux kernel, it is unlikely that we will be able to develop or integrate a GUI within the project’s scope. Therefore, interaction with the system will primarily occur through the terminal, with outputs being generated based on the firewall’s code execution.
