  The purpose of this project is to create a working network firewall. The team wants to create a firewall because internet security is crucial
in ensuring that unsecured devices cannot be compromised by malicious actors. Personal information from a vulnerable device can be compromised 
at an alarming rate and many people are unaware that their data may not be private. Network security continues to be a major problem across the 
globe due to advancing techniques used by hackers to gain access to personal devices. This project aims to help mitigate the effects of malicious
actors and provide users with a safe way to browse the web and use their devices. 

  The teamâ€™s external motive in creating this program is to apply the material learned in our courses about computer networks and operating systems. 
Additionally, this will help reinforce our knowledge of networking and driver programing while using the software engineering (SCRUM) process to 
develop the software. By creating this firewall, our team will be able to enforce data security policies and provide an easy and safe means of 
logging network traffic through our computer. By this project's completion, the team will have created a working firewall and developed a 
greater understanding of computer networking, potential threats, the SCRUM process, and preventative measures to share with our peers.
